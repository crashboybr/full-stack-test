# Full-Stack Developer Test

Hi Full-stacker!

Great that you're interested in this exercise! Thanks a lot for making it. The exercise exists of a few assignments. They are related to the Deskbookers way of working. Good luck and we are looking forward to hearing from you soon!

To complete these assignments you need to fork this repo. When you're done you can push your changes to your own repo (and let us know where to find it ofcourse).

For this assignment it's necessary to have a working Node/NPM setup and a machine with PHP support. You can use your own web server (if you have one) or use XAMP (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) to install one on your own machine.

## Assignment 1: Port old PHP code to Node.JS

In this exercise we have an example database structure and some models which represend them. Included with this exercise is a SQLite3 database, some PHP models and some extra application code.

The task is to setup a small Node application with the same models represented and some application code which does the same thing.
